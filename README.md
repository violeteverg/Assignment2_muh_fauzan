# Traditional Game Landing Page

This is a personal portfolio project showcasing a landing page dedicated to traditional games. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project highlights my skills as a frontend developer.

## Features

### 1. Hamburger Navbar
- **Description**: A responsive hamburger-style navigation menu that appears on mobile devices. The navbar hides when the user scrolls down and reappears when scrolling stops.

### 2. Top Scores Section with Mapping
- **Description**: Displays the top scores of traditional games using dynamically generated cards, mapped through an array of scores in JavaScript.

### 3. Project Carousel
- **Description**: Showcases various traditional games in a carousel format, allowing users to scroll through different games, each represented by a slide with a title, description, and image.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content and layout of the landing page.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including layout, colors, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive features such as the navbar behavior, mapping top scores, carousel functionality, and the accordion component.
